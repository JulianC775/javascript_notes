    *   User profiles (avatars, status, etc.).
    *   Friend system.
*   **Notifications:** Real-time notifications for new messages, mentions, invites, etc.

**High-Level Steps & Considerations:**

1.  **Technology Stack:** Choose a robust backend (e.g., Node.js/Express, Python/Django/FastAPI, Go), a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB), a frontend framework (e.g., React, Vue, Angular), and real-time communication libraries (WebSockets, WebRTC).
2.  **Database Design:** Plan a scalable schema for users, servers, channels, messages, roles, permissions, relationships (friends, members), etc.
3.  **Real-time Backend:** Implement WebSocket handling for message broadcasting, presence updates, channel joins/leaves.
4.  **WebRTC Implementation:** This is complex. Decide on P2P, SFU (Selective Forwarding Unit like Mediasoup/Janus), or MCU (Multipoint Control Unit) architecture for voice/video calls. Handle signaling, STUN/TURN servers for NAT traversal.
5.  **API Development:** Create RESTful or GraphQL APIs for frontend-backend interaction (fetching messages, server info, user data, managing channels, etc.).
6.  **Frontend Development:** Build the user interface, manage application state, handle real-time updates, and integrate with WebRTC for calls.
7.  **Authentication & Authorization:** Secure user accounts and implement a role/permission system for server/channel access control.
8.  **Soundboard Feature:** Implement audio file upload, storage (e.g., S3), and playback logic integrated with voice channels (likely involving sending audio streams via WebRTC or mixing on the server).
9.  **Scalability & Deployment:** Consider server infrastructure, load balancing, database scaling, and deployment strategies (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes, cloud platforms).

**Goal:** Replicate the core user experience of Discord, demonstrating proficiency in full-stack development, real-time technologies (WebSockets, WebRTC), database management, and complex application architecture. This is a portfolio-defining project due to its complexity.

## Minecraft Fishing Automation Bot

**Core Idea:** Create a Python script that automates the fishing process in Minecraft by monitoring screen pixels and simulating mouse actions.

**Key Features/Components:**

*   **Screen Monitoring:** Captures a specific region of the screen (dynamically centered, size configurable).
*   **Pixel Detection:** Identifies a target pixel color (representing the fishing bobber's red line) within the monitored region, using color tolerance for robustness.
*   **Movement Detection:** Tracks the vertical position of the target pixel and detects a sudden drop (downward movement exceeding a threshold).
*   **Automated Action:** When a drop is detected, simulates a sequence of right-clicks: one to hook the fish, followed by a pause, and a second to recast the line.
*   **Configuration:** Adjustable parameters for target color, color tolerance, movement threshold, monitoring region size (as a percentage of screen), and check frequency.
*   **Control:** Uses keyboard hotkeys (e.g., `Ctrl+Alt+S`, `Ctrl+Alt+Q`) to start, stop, and exit the script safely.

**Technology Stack:**

*   **Language:** Python
*   **Libraries:**
    *   `mss`: Screen capture.
    *   `pyautogui`: Mouse simulation (and screen size detection).
    *   `numpy`: Image data manipulation and color comparison.
    *   `keyboard`: Global hotkey listening for script control.
    *   `Pillow`: Image handling (dependency of `mss`).

**Goal:** Build a simple but effective automation tool for a repetitive in-game task, demonstrating skills in screen reading, image processing (basic pixel analysis), input simulation, and Python scripting.

**Potential Challenges:**

*   **Changing Game Visuals:** Lighting changes, weather, texture packs, or game updates could affect target color reliability.
*   **Performance:** Screen capturing/processing can be CPU intensive.
*   **Accuracy:** Timing the action precisely after detection.
*   **Detection Robustness:** Simple color/tolerance matching might still fail in certain conditions (requiring more advanced techniques like OpenCV if needed).
*   **Anti-Cheat:** Risk of detection on servers with strict anti-cheat measures.
