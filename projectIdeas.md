## Discord Soundboard Statistics Bot

**Core Idea:** Develop a Discord bot that logs and analyzes the usage of the server's soundboard.

**Key Features:**

*   **Detailed Logging:** Track which sounds are used, when they are used, and by whom.
*   **Granular Statistics:**
    *   Per-sound usage counts.
    *   Per-user usage statistics (top users, individual stats).
    *   Per-channel usage patterns.
    *   Time-based analysis (daily, weekly, monthly trends, peak times).
*   **Interactive Commands:**
    *   `/sound_stats [sound_name]`: Get stats for a specific sound.
    *   `/top_sounds [period]`: List most popular sounds.
    *   `/bottom_sounds [period]`: List least popular sounds.
    *   `/sound_user_stats [user]`: Show a user's soundboard activity.
    *   `/random_sound`: Play a random sound to encourage discovery.
*   **Gamification (Optional):**
    *   Award roles/achievements for top usage or using unpopular sounds.
    *   Track usage streaks or server-wide milestones.
*   **Admin Features:**
    *   Identify inactive sounds for potential removal.
    *   Alerts for unusual usage spikes.
    *   Data export functionality (e.g., CSV).
*   **Visualization (Optional):**
    *   Simple charts within Discord embeds.
    *   Potential for a companion web dashboard for richer visualizations.

**Goal:** Provide server members and admins with insights into soundboard usage, potentially leading to better sound management and increased user engagement through stats and gamification.

## Comprehensive Fitness Tracker App

**Core Idea:** Develop a web or mobile application for users to log workouts, track calorie intake, and monitor overall fitness progress.

**Key Features:**

*   **Workout Logging:**
    *   Define custom exercises (strength, cardio, flexibility, etc.).
    *   Create and save workout routines/templates.
    *   Log completed workouts with details:
        *   Strength: Sets, reps, weight.
        *   Cardio: Duration, distance, intensity/speed.
        *   Notes for each exercise/workout.
    *   Workout history and calendar view.
*   **Calorie & Nutrition Tracking:**
    *   Searchable food database (potentially integrating a public API like Open Food Facts).
    *   Manual entry for custom foods/meals.
    *   Barcode scanning (if mobile).
    *   Track macronutrients (protein, carbs, fat) alongside calories.
    *   Set daily calorie/macro goals.
    *   View daily/weekly/monthly nutrition summaries.
*   **Progress Monitoring:**
    *   Track body measurements (weight, body fat %, muscle circumference - user configurable).
    *   Visualize progress over time with charts/graphs (e.g., weight loss trend, strength increase for specific exercises).
    *   Personal bests (PRs) tracking for exercises.
*   **User Management:**
    *   User accounts and secure data storage.
    *   Personalized dashboards summarizing key stats.
*   **Optional Features:**
    *   Recipe builder to calculate nutrition for homemade meals.
    *   Water intake tracking.
    *   Integration with fitness wearables (e.g., syncing steps or heart rate data via APIs like Google Fit/Apple HealthKit - complex).
    *   Social features (sharing workouts/progress with friends - consider privacy implications).

**Goal:** Provide a user-friendly, all-in-one platform for individuals to manage their workout routines, monitor their diet, and visualize their fitness journey and achievements.
